PDF File Methods
PDF File Supplementary Materials

CAO: .stl files for the experimental systems.

Codes: Python scripts to
- numerics/dynamics/: perform the numerical simulations of the active elastic structures presented in the manuscript.
- numerics/normal_modes/: compute the normal modes of the elastic structures presented in the manuscript and sort them by symmetry classes.
- experiments/tracking_algorithm/: perform the tracking (positions and orientations) of the experimental movies.

For Data: Experimental movies (.mp4) for all the experiments presented in the manuscript and associated data (.csv) obtained from tracking see https://zenodo.org/record/6653906
