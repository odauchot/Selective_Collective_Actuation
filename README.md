# Selective_Collective_Actuation
Methods, Supp Materials and Codes associated with Nature Physics 18, pp. 1234-1239 (2022)

This is the replication package supporting the paper "Selective and Collective Actuation in Active Solids" 	
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2110.01516

It contains:

CAO: .stl files for the experimental systems.

Codes: Python scripts to
- numerics/dynamics/: perform the numerical simulations of the active elastic structures presented in the manuscript.
- numerics/normal_modes/: compute the normal modes of the elastic structures presented in the manuscript and sort them by symmetry classes.
- experiments/tracking_algorithm/: perform the tracking (positions and orientations) of the experimental movies.

Data: Experimental movies (.mp4) for all the experiments presented in the manuscript and associated data (.csv) obtained from tracking.
